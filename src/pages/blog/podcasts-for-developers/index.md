title: "Podcasts For Developers"
excerpt: "If you're a developer, you may be wanting to improve your skills but lack the time to devote in reading books, watching videos, or reading articles (glad you're reading this one though!). So, how do we go about our normal days while still leveling up? Podcasts. More specifically, audio podcasts which are much like radio shows but on specific topics. The great part about them is being able to listen while doing other tasks. As you can guess, we will list ones that discuss developer-related topics as curated by our team."

If you're a developer, you may be wanting to improve your skills but lack the time to devote in reading books, watching videos, or reading articles (glad you're reading this one though!). So, how do we go about our normal days while still leveling up? Podcasts. More specifically, audio podcasts which are much like radio shows but on specific topics. The great part about them is being able to listen while doing other tasks. As you can guess, we will list ones that discuss developer-related topics as curated by our team.

[ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/) is "a web design and development podcast with Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert."

Both hosts are well-known in the web design industry, and you've probably came across Chris' website, [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), multiple times. What's great about ShopTalk is not only the hosts' humor (hats off to Dave's sound effects), but the catering to both beginner and advanced audiences. They typically answer various coding questions that will surely save you some Googling when you encounter the same problem, but also do interviews from time to time.
